Here you have the Azure ARM Template to depoy the API application and an example parameters file.
Stay in mind that the parameters file could have  "secrets" and/or "passwords", and so it is here
as a reference ONLY. So you can download  and update it  with  your own specific information, and 
save it in a private location for further use (e.g.: your own machine).
